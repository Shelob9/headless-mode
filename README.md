A helper plugin for putting WordPress in "headless mode". Designed for when WordPress is the CMS for a headless / decoupled WordPress site.

## What This Plugin Does
This plugin blocks all requests to a WordPress site except for:

* wp-admin
* The WordPress REST API
* wp-cron (debatable)
* [WP GraphQL](https://www.wpgraphql.com/)

This is largely based on a code snippet from Jason Bahl of WP GraphQL.
