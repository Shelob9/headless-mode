## Getting Started

  * https://github.com/shelob9/headless-mode/issues
  * Clearly describe the issue including steps to reproduce the bug.
  * Make sure you fill in the earliest version that you know has the issue as well as the version of WordPress you're using.

## Making Changes

* Fork the repository on GitHub.
* Make the changes to your forked repository's code.
* Ensure that all separate issues are split into individual commits. This helps us to be able to review the changes. For example, if you are making code format changes alongside fixing a bug, commit those changes separately.
* Ensure you stick to the [WordPress Coding Standards](http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Coding_Standards).
* Create a new branch, named `/issue/##` with the `##` matching the issue that is being resolved.
* When committing, reference your issue (if present) and include a note about the fix.
* Push the changes to the branch you created and submit a pull request for the master branch here.

At this point you're waiting on us to merge your pull request. We'll review all pull requests, and make suggestions and changes if necessary.
